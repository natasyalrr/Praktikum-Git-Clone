    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

    <p>
        <span class="target-highlight">
            The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta is an Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="target-highlight">The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="target-highlight">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span class="target-highlight">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="target-highlight">Building Engineering Education</span>, and <span class="target-highlight">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="target-highlight">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
